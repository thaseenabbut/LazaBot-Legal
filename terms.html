        <h2 id="section1">1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>LazaBot is designed to assist Discord servers with moderation, and its Terms of Service (ToS) set the rules for how users can use it. This document ensures everyone understands their responsibilities and rights, especially since Discord requires bots to have a ToS for verification and operation.</p>
        <p>Welcome to LazaBot! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of LazaBot and its associated website dashboard. By using LazaBot, you agree to comply with these Terms. Please read them carefully.</p>

        <h2 id="section2">2. Background and Context</h2>
        <p>LazaBot, designed to assist Discord servers globally with moderation, requires a Terms of Service to outline user responsibilities, ownership rights, and liability, especially given Discord’s requirement for bots to have a ToS for verification (<a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/policies">Discord Developer Policy</a>).</p>

        <h2 id="section3">3. User Eligibility: Age and Permissions</h2>
        <p>The ToS must specify user eligibility, aligning with Discord’s terms that users must be at least 13 years old (<a href="https://discord.com/terms">Terms of Service | Discord</a>). For LazaBot, this means stating that users must be 13 or older, and if under the age of majority, they need parental consent. Given LazaBot’s use in servers, the primary users are server administrators, who must have sufficient permissions to invite and configure the bot.</p>

        <h2 id="section4">4. Use of the Bot: Dashboard and Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>LazaBot’s functionality includes a dashboard, requiring Discord authentication, which is stored for 7 days, as per the user’s privacy policy details.</p>

        <h2 id="section5">5. User Conduct and Prohibited Uses</h2>
        <p>You agree to use LazaBot only for its intended purpose of server moderation and not for any unauthorized, harmful, or abusive activities. Specifically, you are prohibited from:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Using LazaBot for purposes other than moderation:</strong> LazaBot’s features, such as message filtering, role management, and logging, are designed to support server management. Any use beyond these intended functions is strictly forbidden.</li>
            <li><strong>Sending direct message advertisements:</strong> You may not use LazaBot to send unsolicited advertisements, promotional messages, or spam via direct messages to users. This includes using the bot to distribute marketing content without explicit user consent.</li>
            <li><strong>Sending multiple messages in a short time span:</strong> You are prohibited from configuring or using LazaBot to flood users, channels, or servers with excessive messages in a short period, whether through automated commands or manual abuse. This includes rapid-fire messaging intended to disrupt or annoy.</li>
            <li><strong>Abusing LazaBot in any other way:</strong> Any action that violates these Terms, Discord’s <a href="https://discord.com/terms">Terms of Service</a>, or Discord’s <a href="https://discord.com/guidelines">Community Guidelines</a> is prohibited. Examples include, but are not limited to, using LazaBot to harass, intimidate, distribute malware, or engage in illegal activities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="section6">6. Reporting Abuse</h2>
        <p>If you discover that someone is abusing LazaBot’s features—such as using it for prohibited purposes, exploiting its functionality, or violating these Terms—please report it to us immediately. Contact us at <a href="https://discord.gg/pZbC5zJSCN">support discord server</a> by creating a ticket with details of the abuse, including the server name and ID, user IDs, and a description of the incident. Prompt reporting helps us maintain the integrity of LazaBot and protect the Discord community.</p>

        <h2 id="section7">7. Ownership and Rights: Intellectual Property and Brand Features</h2>
        <p>Ownership of LazaBot’s code and materials must be clearly stated, with users having no rights to copy, modify, or distribute the bot’s code. Additionally, the user provided that LazaBot may use server brand features (names and logos) for marketing, which should be included, ensuring transparency about usage rights.</p>

        <h2 id="section8">8. Data Handling: Linking to Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>Data handling should refer to the privacy policy for details, as per the user’s input, including the 30-day deletion period after bot removal, except for backups or log data. This ensures users understand data practices without duplicating the privacy policy.</p>
        <p>For details about how we collect, use, and store data, please refer to our [Privacy Policy.](https://thaseenabbut.github.io/LazaBot-Legal/privacy.html)</p>

        <h2 id="section9">9. Liability: “As Is” Provision and Indemnification</h2>
        <p>Liability must be limited, stating LazaBot is provided “as is” with no warranties, and the developer is not responsible for damages or losses, a common practice to mitigate risk (<a href="https://discord.com/terms">Terms of Service | Discord</a>). Users must also agree to indemnify the developer against claims arising from their use, protecting against legal actions.</p>

        <h2 id="section10">10. Termination: Conditions and Data Handling</h2>
        <p>Termination conditions should cover the developer’s right to remove the bot from a server or terminate access if terms are violated, aligning with Discord’s enforcement policies (<a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/legal">Discord Developer Terms of Service</a>). Upon termination, data handling follows the privacy policy, ensuring compliance with retention practices.</p>

        <h2>11. Data Deletion After Removal</h2
<p>
  When a server removes LazaBot, all associated data (such as server configurations, logs, and stored preferences) 
  is permanently deleted within <strong>30 days</strong> of removal.
</p>

<p>
  This policy aligns with Discord’s 
  <a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/policies-and-agreements/developer-terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    Developer Terms
  </a> 
  to ensure user data privacy and protection.

  </a> 
  to ensure user data privacy and protection.
</p>

        <h2 id="section12">12. Changes to Terms: Updates and Acceptance</h2>
        <p>The ToS must allow for updates, with continued use constituting acceptance, a standard clause to maintain flexibility. This ensures the developer can adapt to changes in Discord’s policies or legal requirements.</p>

        <h2 id="section13">13. Additional Notes: Third-Party Status and Contact</h2>
        <p>An important aspect is clarifying that LazaBot is a third-party service, not endorsed by Discord, to manage user expectations and direct concerns to the developer, not Discord. Contact information, such as an email, should be provided for users to reach out, ensuring accessibility.</p>
